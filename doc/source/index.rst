Welcome to Sarepy's documentation about removing ring artifacts in tomography.
This documentation is not only to explain functions used in the Sarepy package
but also to cover the following topics:

    - > Causes of ring artifacts.
    - > Classification of ring artifacts.
    - > How ring removal methods work; pros and cons of each method; how to use
      them efficiently; and how to improve them.
    - > Applications of the methods.

**Author:** Nghia Vo, Diamond Light Source.

**Keywords:** Ring artifact removal, Tomography, Stripe artifacts, Tutorial.

Importance notice
-----------------
Starting 05/2021, methods in **Sarepy** have been integrated and developed further in
the **Algotom** package, https://github.com/algotom/algotom . Algotom (Ref. [3])
is a complete software package for processing tomographic reconstruction. It is
installable using Conda and Pip.
