Welcome to Sarepy's documentation about removing ring artifacts in tomography.
This documentation is not only to explain functions used in the Sarepy package
but also to cover the following topics:

- Causes of ring artifacts.
- Classification of ring artifacts.
- How ring removal methods work; pros and cons of each method; how to use them efficiently; and how to improve them.
- Applications of the methods.

**Source code:** https://github.com/nghia-vo/sarepy

**Author:** Nghia Vo, Diamond Light Source.

**Keywords:** ring artifact removal, tomography, stripe artifacts, tutorial.

*Importance notice:*
--------------------
Starting 05/2021, methods in **Sarepy** have been integrated and developed further in
the **Algotom** package, https://github.com/algotom/algotom . Algotom is a
complete software package for processing tomographic reconstruction. It is
installable using Conda and Pip.
