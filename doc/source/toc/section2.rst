Classification of stripe artifact types
***************************************

Occurrence of stripe artifacts (ring artifacts in reconstructed images)
depending on a sample makes it difficult to find a generic approach for
removing them. Furthermore, there are many types of stripe artifacts which may
require different ways of treatment. The use of pre-processing techniques such
as distortion correction or phase retrieval blurs and enlarges these stripes,
making it even more challenging to clean them. It is important to understand
physical causes of stripe artifacts and classify them. This helps to tackle the
problem most efficiently. By comparing the intensity profile, which
is the plot of measured intensities against angles, of a defective pixel
with its adjacent non-defective pixel we can classify stripe artifacts into four
different types.

Full stripe
============

    A typical profile of a full stripe exhibits intensities that are offset at all
    angles compared with that of a neighboring good pixel (Fig. 1(a, b)). It gives
    rise to a half-ring artifact (in 180-degree scanning tomography) in the reconstructed
    image (Fig. 1(c)).

      (arrowed). (b) Intensity profile along the stripe (red color) in comparison

      reconstructed image.

Partial stripe
==============

    Different to a full stripe, intensities of a partial stripe are offset only
    at certain ranges of angles as demonstrated in Fig. 2. As a result, it gives
    rise to a partial ring artifact in the reconstructed image (Fig. 2(c)).

.. _dead_stripe:

Unresponsive stripe
===================

    Intensities of this type of stripe are independent of angles. A pixel is
    not responsive to the variation of intensity versus angles as the same way
    as its neighboring good pixel. This type of stripes may come from dead pixels
    of a sensor chip, light-blocking dusts or damaged scintillator (bright blobs
    in Fig. 3(a)) giving rise to stripes of constant brightness as clearly visible
    in Fig. 3(b). Missing information in these stripes strongly affects the
    reconstructed image; the constant intensity results in a prominent half-ring,
    and high-frequency edges of the stripes cause severe streak artifacts
    (Fig. 3(c)).

      artifact (red arrows) and streak artifacts (yellow arrows) in the
      reconstructed image.

Fluctuating stripe
==================

    Intensities inside this type of stripe fluctuate significantly across angles.
    The stripe may be caused by defective pixels of a sensor chip rather than optical
    components. They are extremely small in number and their size is often between 1 or
    2 pixels. Like unresponsive stripes, they give rise to both ring artifacts
    and streak artifacts as demonstrated in Fig. 4.

.. _other_stripes:

Other types of stripes
======================

    There are other types of stripes which are combinations of above stripes
    or the extension of them such as large stripes (Fig. 5) or blurry stripes.
    Blurry stripes may come from the use of pre-processing methods such as phase
    retrieval or distortion correction.  Large stripes are caused by large defects
    in a detector which are not always visible in radiographs. They may come from
    adjacent areas of a damaged scintillator which receives extra scattering light,
    i.e. the so-called halo effect, as shown in Fig. 5. Large stripes may need a separate
    treatment to reduce side effects of cleaning methods.
