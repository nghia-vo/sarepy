=============================================

Fft-based methods rely on the assumption that ring artifacts are corresponding
to high-frequency components in the Fourier domain. As a result, they can
be removed by damping these components. The following methods are similar to
the preprocessing fft-based methods. However, they work on reconstructed images
instead of sinograms where the polar transform is used to convert ring artifacts to
stripe artifacts.

**Using the Fourier transform**

    **Code**

        .. autofunction:: sarepy.post.ring_removal_post.ring_removal_based_fft

    **How it works**

         Input image is transformed into polar coordinates. The Fourier
         transform is applied to the result. A 1D low-pass window is
         multiplied with the row corresponding to the zero frequency in the vertical
         direction and its neighbors to remove the stripes. The resulting image is
         transformed into Cartesian coordinates.

    **How to use**

         -- The *u* parameter controls the strength of the cleaning capability.
         Smaller is stronger. Recommended starting value: 30. |br|
         -- The *n* parameter defines the shape of the low-pass filter. It's an
         insensitive parameter. Recommended value : 8. |br|
         -- The *v* parameter allows to select how many rows around the
         zero-frequency row to be multiplied with the low-pass window. Larger *v*
         increases void-center artifacts. Recommended value: 1. |br|
         -- The *pad* parameter is needed to reduce the side effects of the Fourier
         transform.

**Using the Fourier transform and wavelet decomposition**

    **Code**

        .. autofunction:: sarepy.post.ring_removal_post.ring_removal_based_wavelet_fft

    **How it works**

         It's very similar to the fft-based method. The improvement is that the polar
         transformed image is decomposed using the wavelet transform then the low-pass filter is applied
         to each of the decomposed image.

    **How to use**

         -- The *level* parameter controls the decomposition level. Higher "level"
         means stronger cleaning capability. It is because applying the low-pass
         filter at a deeper level (corresponding to a smaller-size image) results in
         stronger impact to the recombined image. |br|
         -- The *sigma* parameter also controls the strength of the cleaning
         capability. Larger is stronger, but also increases void-center artifacts. |br|
         -- The *order* parameter is insensitive. Recommended value: 8. |br|
         -- The *pad* parameter is needed to reduce the side effects of the Fourier
         transform.
