Method for removing large stripes
=================================

A strongly smoothing filter is needed to remove :ref:`large stripes <other_stripes>`.
This, however, degrades the processed sinogram and gives rise to extra artifacts.
To solve these problems, the correction is selectively applied to stripe locations
only, which requires the :ref:`stripe detection method <stripe_detection>`.
Detailed implementations of the method is shown as follows.

**How it works**

    *1. Locating stripe artifacts*

        -- Sort intensities in each column of the sinogram (Fig. 2(a)). Apply the
        strong median filter along each row to remove stripes (Fig. 2(b)).

        -- Average along the columns of the sorted sinogram where some percentage
        of pixels at the top and bottom are dropped (Fig. 3(a), Fig. 4(a)). Do the
        same for the smoothed sinogram (Fig. 3(b), Fig. 4(b)). This simple technique
        helps to reduce the possibility of wrongly detecting stripes caused by
        high-frequency edges of the sinogram . It also can be used to improve other
        ring removal :ref:`methods <norm_method>`.

        -- Divide the result shown in Fig. 4(a) to the result shown in Fig. 4(b) resulting
        in the normalized 1D array (Fig. 5(a)). Use the :ref:`SFTS algorithm <stripe_detection>`
        to get stripe locations (Fig. 5(b)).

            indicating the stripe locations.

    *2. Normalization*

        -- Normalize each row of the sinogram using the result shown in Fig. 5(a). This
        step is important to correct the non-uniform background around :ref:`large stripes <other_stripes>`.
        Actually, it is a normalization-based stripe removal method. As a result,
        it can suppress full stripe artifacts but not partial stripe artifacts (Fig. 6).

    *3. Selective correction*

        -- Partial stripes are removed using the sorting-based approach where only the
        intensities in the stripes of the normalized sinogram are corrected (Fig. 7).

**How to use**

  -- The *snr* parameter controls the sensitivity of the stripe detection
  method. Smaller is more sensitive. Recommended values: 1.1 -> 3.0. |br|
  -- The *size* parameter controls the strength of the median filter and can
  be determined in a straightforward way by the size and the brightness of
  detector defects. Larger is stronger but more computationally expensive.
  As this method is selective correction, overestimated *size* is acceptable
  without degrading the final image too much. This allows users
  to use the same parameters across sinograms.

**How to improve**

  The median filter can be replaced by another edge-preserving smoothing filter.
