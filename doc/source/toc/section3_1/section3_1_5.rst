Method for removing unresponsive and fluctuating stripes
========================================================

:ref:`Unresponsive and fluctuating stripes <dead_stripe>` give rise to both ring
artifacts and streak artifacts in the reconstructed image (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, they
cannot be removed using the smoothing-based approaches as in the previous
methods because intensity profiles are significantly different
between pixels inside stripes and outside stripes.  A simple way of
removing them is to use an interpolation technique after locating them.
The intensity profiles of those stripes show opposite characteristics. The
unresponsive stripe shows very little variation while the fluctuating stripe
shows excessive variation. Exploiting these features can help us detect them all
together.

**How it works**

    *1. Locating stripe artifacts*

        -- Apply the strong mean filter along each column of the sinogram
        (Fig. 2(a)). Take absolute values of the difference between the result
        and the original sinogram (Fig. 1(a)) resulting in Fig. 2(b).

            Absolute difference between (a) and Fig. 1(a).

        -- Average along each column of Fig. 2(b) resulting a 1D array (Fig. 3(a)). Apply the
        strong median filter to this array resulting in Fig. 3(b).

            applying the median filter to (a).

        -- Divide the result shown in Fig. 3(a) to the result shown in Fig. 3(b) resulting
        in the normalized 1D array (Fig. 4(a)). Use the :ref:`SFTS algorithm <stripe_detection>`
        to get stripe locations (Fig. 4(b)).

    *2. Correcting by interpolation*

        -- Interpolate values inside the stripes from neighboring pixels.

    *3. Removing residual stripes (Optional)*

        -- Apply the algorithm of :ref:`removing large stripes <remove_large_stripe>`
        to remove residual stripes. This step may be needed because intensities
        around dead pixels are modulated by the scattered light resulting large stripes.

**How to use**

  -- The *snr* parameter controls the sensitivity of the stripe detection
  method. Smaller is more sensitive. Recommended values: 1.1 -> 3.0. |br|
  -- The *size* parameter controls the strength of the median filter
  and can be determined in a straightforward way by the size of dead pixels.
