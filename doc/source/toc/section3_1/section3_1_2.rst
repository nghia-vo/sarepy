Normalization-based methods
---------------------------

Normalization-based methods rely on the assumption that stripe artifacts are
mainly the full stripe type, i.e the intensity offsets of these stripes are
constant across the angular direction. Different methods use different ways of
calculating these offsets. Sinogram correction is done by adding or multiplying
these offsets to the original sinogram. |br|

Using a smoothing filter
++++++++++++++++++++++++

    **Code**

            .. autofunction:: sarepy.prep.stripe_removal_former.remove_stripe_based_normalization

    **How it works**

        Offsets are calculated by: averaging intensities along the angular
        direction; applying a smoothing filter to the result; subtracting these two.

    **How to use**

        -- The *sigma* parameter controls the strength of the cleaning capability.
        Larger is stronger. |br|
        -- The *num_chunk* parameter is used to divide a sinogram into multipe chunks of rows.
        This improvement helps to tackle partial stripes, however, it gives rise
        to void-center artifacts. |br|

    **How to improve**

        -- Can combine with the :ref:`sorting-based method <sorting>` to avoid
        void-center artifacts.

Using a regularizer
+++++++++++++++++++

    **Code**

    .. autofunction:: sarepy.prep.stripe_removal_former.remove_stripe_based_regularization

    **How it works**

      Firstly, intensities along the angular direction are averaged. Then, the
      1st discrete difference of the result is calculated. The offsets are
      determined by minimizing the differentiated result using a regularizer [2].

    **How to use**

      -- The *alpha* parameter controls the strength of the cleaning capability.
      Smaller is stronger. Recommended values: 0.01 -> 0.0001 |br|
      -- The *num_chunk* parameter is used to divide the sinogram into multipe chunks of rows.
      This improvement helps to tackle partial stripes, however, it gives rise
      to void-center artifacts. |br|

    **How to improve**

        -- Can combine with the :ref:`sorting-based method <sorting>` to avoid
        the void-center artifacts.

Fft-based methods
-----------------

Fft-based methods rely on the assumption that stripe artifacts are corresponding
to high-frequency components in the Fourier domain. As a result, they can
be removed by damping these components.  |br|

Using the Fourier transform
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    **Code**

        .. autofunction:: sarepy.prep.stripe_removal_former.remove_stripe_based_fft

    **How it works**

        The Fourier transform is applied to a sinogram. A 1D low-pass window is
        multiplied with the row corresponding to the zero frequency in the vertical
        direction and its neighbors to remove stripes.

    **How to use**

        -- The *u* parameter controls the strength of the cleaning capability.
        Smaller is stronger. Recommended starting value: 30. |br|
        -- The *n* parameter defines the shape of the low-pass filter. It's an
        insensitive parameter. Recommended value : 8. |br|
        -- The *v* parameter allows to select how many rows around the
        zero-frequency row to be multiplied with the low-pass window. Larger *v*
        increases void-center artifacts. Recommended value: 1. |br|
        -- The *pad* parameter is needed to reduce side effects of the Fourier
        transform.

    **How to improve**

        -- Can combine with the :ref:`sorting-based method <sorting>` to avoid
        void-center artifacts.

Using the Fourier transform and wavelet decomposition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    **Code**

        .. autofunction:: sarepy.prep.stripe_removal_former.remove_stripe_based_wavelet_fft

    **How it works**

        It's very similar to the fft-based method. The improvement is that a sinogram is
        decomposed using the wavelet transform then a low-pass filter is applied
        to each of the decomposed image.

    **How to use**

        -- The *level* parameter controls the decomposition level. Higher "level"
        means stronger cleaning capability. It is because applying the low-pass
        filter at a deeper level (corresponding to a smaller-size image) resulting in
        stronger impact to the recombined image. |br|
        -- The *sigma* parameter also controls the strength of the cleaning
        capability. Larger is stronger, but also increases void-center artifacts. |br|
        -- The *order* parameter is insensitive. Recommended value: 8. |br|
        -- The *pad* parameter is needed to reduce side effects of the Fourier
        transform.

    **How to improve**

        -- Can combine with the :ref:`sorting-based method <sorting>` to avoid
        void-center artifacts.
