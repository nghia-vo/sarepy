Ring artifacts in a reconstructed image (Fig. 1a), corresponding to stripe
artifacts in the sinogram (Fig. 1b), come from two major sources:

   1. Irregular responses of a detecting system.
   2. Uncorrelated pixels between images with sample (projections) and images
      without sample (flat-field or white-field images).

Irregular responses of a detecting system
-----------------------------------------

    Irregular responses of a detecting system are caused by defects in
    different parts of the system such as the non-linear response of a sensor chip,
    dust on optics components (lens, mirrors…), and especially a scintillator,
    which is the major contributor. As can be seen in Fig. 2, defects from a scintillator
    are clearly visible.

      Figure 2. Flat-field image shows defects of a scintillator

    However, there are invisible defects which also result in stripe artifacts but
    can only be revealed by analysing the linear response of a detector. Analysis
    can be performed by acquiring projections through an X-ray absorber (e.g a glass
    plate) at different thicknesses by rotating the plate in the range of 0 degree
    to ~80 degree (to make sure that the plate doesn't block X-ray completely).
    Lines were fitted to the measured intensities of every pixel based on the
    Beer-Lambert’s law. Intercepts and slopes of the fitting results of all
    pixels (Fig. 3) help to reveal the underlying information about the quality of the
    scintillator.

    Retrieved response maps are useful to characterize detector systems and can
    be used to correct irregular responses of large size detectors where the response
    of each pixel is independent. However, in synchrotron-based micro-tomography
    systems, where scintillators are mainly unstructured types to achieve high
    resolution, this cannot be done due to the scattering of scintillation photons (Fig. 4)
    making the response of each pixel depend on its neighbors.

      scintillator-coupled X-ray detector by taking a flat-field image with a half
      field of view blocked. (a) Under 0.05s of exposure time. (b) Under 0.5s of
      exposure time.

    As a result, the shape and absorption characteristics of a sample dictate the
    influence of scattered light to the response of a pixel. This means that the
    occurrence of artifacts depend on samples and projection angles. Figure 6
    shows reconstructed images at the same slice of three samples with different
    shapes and absorption characteristics (Fig. 5) where all tomographic datasets
    were collected under the same conditions. As can be seen, there are ring
    artifacts in sample 3 which don't occur in sample 1 and 2.

Mismatched pixels in flat-field image
-------------------------------------

    The second source of ring artifacts comes from the flat-field correction
    process based on the Beer-Lambert’s law

    .. math::

      \frac{I}{I_0} = \int_{}e^{-\alpha (x,y,z) dx}

    in practice, it is done using the following formula

    .. math::

      \frac{P_{\theta}-D}{F-D}

    where :math:`P_{\theta}` is a projection image of a sample at a rotation
    angle of :math:`\theta`, :math:`D` is a dark-field image taken with a photon
    source off, and :math:`F` is a flat-field image taken without the sample.
    This process is applied to all projections and it is here that fixed features
    in a flat-field image which are uncorrelated to projection images give
    rise to stripe artifacts in sinograms or ring artifacts in reconstructed
    images. Figure 7 shows two types of fixed features which can be found in
    flat-field images. The first one is zingers caused by scattered x-rays
    hitting the CCD chip directly (Fig. 7(a)). The second one is blobs
    (Fig. 7(b)) introduced by X-ray optics components in a synchrotron-based tomography system.
    These blobs can be shifted during data acquisition process due to the heat load
    resulting in uncorrelated pixels between projections and the flat-field image.
